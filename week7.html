    	<h1>Milestone 3: Functional Prototype 1</h1>
    	<br />
    	
    <h3>What happened this week</h3>
      <div class="row-fluid">
      	<div class="span8 columns">
      		<p>Based on our Wizard of Oz prototyping session last week, we came into class on Tuesday still feeling very not 
      		completely satisfied with our idea and during class talked about pivoting to a new idea about creating an application
      		that would allow fencers to practice by using the Leap to track the angles and positions of their wrist and in turn,
      		show the user a computer generated wrist of an opponent fencer, thereby training the user to deflect jabs of the 
      		opponent by observing the movements and positions of the opponent's wrist. After agreeing on this idea after class,
      		we started to implement the functional prototype for Thursday.</p>
			
			<p>Since our coach didn't show during the coach meet-and-greet a few weeks ago, we finally had the chance to meet
			with Rob Ryan, our mentor, on Wednesday night. We explained our situation to Rob and he led us back to square one 
			in terms of brainstorming ideas and designing to solve needs. This turned into a massive 3.5 hour brainstorm and 
			work session. We went through a lot of whiteboarding of ideas. At first, we honed in on the application area of 
			travel, specifically traveling to Asia, and a few problem areas that arose there were: something to do with
			dirty squat toilets in Asia, haggling, communicating over the language barrier, and jaywalking.</p>
			<br />
			
			<p>Images of our first brainstorm session about travel</p>
			<a href="img/week7_1.jpg" class="thumbnail" target="_blank"><img src="img/week7_1.jpg"></a>
			<a href="img/week7_2.jpg" class="thumbnail" target="_blank"><img src="img/week7_2.jpg"></a>
			<a href="img/week7_3.jpg" class="thumbnail" target="_blank"><img src="img/week7_3.jpg"></a>
			<br />
						
			<p>However, in generating possible solutions to solve these problems above, again really focusing on the
			need aspect of the design, we got stuck again. The problems in the area of toilets and bathrooms in Asia resonated
			deeply with us, but the biggest problems we sas were simply: the toilets were dirty, smelled bad, and unhygenic, 
			which were not problems we could see the Leap helping to solve. Other problems, like haggling, were found to have
			knowledge at the center. For example, we thought of an application that could help sellers and customers agree
			on a price by having them move their hand up or down in correspondence with the price of the sale, such that agreeing
			would mean their hands were on the same level. However, we went deeper and realized that that was not the main problem
			of haggling--the main problem is not knowing if you (the buyer) is getting ripped off or not due to being a foreigner.
			This problem was not one we saw gestures being very useful for. </p>
			<br />
			
			<p>Images of our second brainstorm session about payments, acting out the experience</p>
			<a href="img/week7_4.jpg" class="thumbnail" target="_blank"><img src="img/week7_4.jpg"></a>
			<a href="img/week7_5.jpg" class="thumbnail" target="_blank"><img src="img/week7_5.JPG"></a>

			<a href="img/week7_acting.jpg" class="thumbnail" target="_blank"><img src="img/week7_acting.jpg"></a>
			<br />
			
			<p>Thus, we went back to brainstorming again. We finally came to talking about the problem of losing and keeping
			receipts, losing track of your purchases. From there, we started to bond over how signing receipts in stores
			doesn't really do anything - it seems like signatures would be used for identity confirmation, but they are never
			checked. We started to talk about environmental issues as well, and speculated how many trees could be saved by
			simply not printing out receipts at the end of every transaction and instead making the experience purely digital.
			Having each known and talked to people who have had their credit card numbers stolen, we also converged on the need to improve
			security in making purchases. This being a particularly bad flu season, we also talked about the need to 
			prevent the spreading of illnesses in public spaces or publicly used items, such as the pens people use to sign
			their receipts in busy supermarkets or stores.</p>

        <h3>Our final idea and Looking Forward</h3>
      <div class="row-fluid">
      	<div class="span8 columns">
      		<p>Our final idea is a simpler, more secure, and gesture/digital-based point of sale system. This system
      		would let customers digitally sign their receipts by signing in the air and would be more secure by incorporating
      		photographic elements and actually checking the signature against the buyer's other signatures in the past.
      		This system, using just a laptop and LEAP, could potentially replace very expensive payment machines and systems
      		already in large stores, and could be very useful for small businesses who don't have a lot of money to spend on
      		their payment systems.</p>
			
			<p>Feature choices with Rationale</p>
			<ol>
				<li >Credit Card Detection</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Rationale:</li>
						<p>While you could hand over your credit card to the 
						cashier to swipe and process the payment, there is still the hygienic issue
						of someone else touching your credit card. With our system, we want to eliminate the need
						to hand over your credit card (minimizing the possibility of even the cashier stealing 
						your identity or overcharging you), so simply scanning your card into our system
						would be safe and clean. </p>
					</ul>
				<li >Photo Authentication</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Rationale:</li>
						<p>Sometimes stores don't check your photo ID upon purchase with a credit card, which makes
						it easier for theft to occur. Our system would compare your photo ID on record with the way
						you look now in the store by leveraging the web cam of the laptop.</p>
					</ul>
				<li >Visual receipt</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Rationale:</li>
						<p>Receipts are sometimes hard to read and check over for items simply because each item is
						described in a way that's foreign to the customer, for example, a pair of skinny blue jeans
						with flower patterns down the side of the leg could just be
						called "JEANS BDCDT" on the receipt, which doesn't meet the customer's mental model toward the
						jeans. Instead, a visual receipt will allow users to quickly scan and check their purchases because
						users can quickly match the image on the receipt with the real item. This matching activity is
						more efficient and accurate than having to translate and then match
						obscure text labels of objects assigned by
						the store to the objects users have bought.</p>
					</ul>
				<li >Digital Signature (with confirmation of signature authenticity)</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Rationale:</li>
						<p>Stores don't verify your signature. Several of the people we talked to had actually experimented
						with signing differently on receipts just to see if anything would happen (for example, signing 
						upside down, just writing a line or drawing a circle, etc.) This makes theft
						easier and seems counterintuitive - a signature
						should help to increase security. By having the customer sign and approve their
						purchase with the LEAP and then verifying it digitally, we add a layer of security to the buying
						process. The virtual in-air signature that uses gestures is better than the current system of just
						having a pen and a machine to sign on because it is more hygienic as well.
						</p>
					</ul>
				<li >Creating and curating a storage space for digital receipts</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Rationale:</li>
						<p>From <a href="http://blog.softwareadvice.com/articles/retail/please-kill-the-paper-receipt-102310/">
						this website</a> we gather that the environmental footprint due to creating paper receipts is
						HUGE. According to the website, receipt paper demands in the US are 640,000 tons per year, which
						equates to 9,600,000 millions trees cut down each year just to produce paper receipts. From there, there is 
						even more damage done with the amount of water, oil, and CO2 used and emitted. Thus, there really is a 
						need to move from paper receipts to digital ones. By keeping receipts digitally in one place,
						we prevent customers from losing physical receipts as well, which saves them from stress and 
						makes it easier to verify their purchases when they have to pay off their credit cards. </p>
					</ul>
			</ol> 
			
			<p>Implementation Progress: Because we struggled so much with music early on in the process of this project and
			then started to implement the fencing app idea on Tuesday, only to pivot to this final idea, we have unfortunately
			not been able to create our first functional prototype in time for class today. However, we have prototyped the system
			by acting it out ourselves and will come to class on Thursday with a 
			<a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1dyFljgcJx67YeoqYbvnzv6AhRlbe5tBEJ7K2WRSpiO0/edit?usp=sharing">wizard of oz</a>
			instead to still collect feedback 
			and test out the idea/get feedback from our peers and the course staff before implementation. We will definitely
			catch up to the milestone on user testing for next week--but our delayed progress this week is
			simply due to a delayed first meeting with our mentor and pivoting from our initial idea.</p>
			
			<p>Prioritized To-Do in Implementation and Design</p>
			<ol>
				<li >Thursday 2/21: Email around campus to ask if we can set up system in real environment to test</li>
				<li >Thursday 2/21 and Friday 2/22: Do more wizard of oz testing and crummy trials</li>
				<li >Friday 2/22 - Sunday 2/24: Work on signature detection, recording, confirmation</li>
				<li >Saturday 2/23: Work on credit card detection and photo authentication</li>
				<li >Monday 2/25: Work on visual receipt and figuring out how to store receipts as PDFs</li>
				<li >By Tues 2/26 First functional prototype done, test in Tresidder or real world situation</li>
			</ol> 
			
			<p>Preliminary Thoughts for User Testing</p>
			<ol>
				<li >Fake check out line experience</li>
				<li >Ask a booth in Tresidder to try it with real clients</li>
				<li >Test on students, elderly, moms - people likely to have lots going on and potentially lose lots of receipts</li>
				<li >Test in bookstore</li>
			</ol>
