				<p>First grade is a critical time for young readers - the time where most children define 
				themselves as either good or poor readers.  Students generally strive to learn to read simple 
				books by mid-year and to understand that letters represent sounds that form words, sounding out
				 unfamiliar words when reading. Reading is an important part of the daily curriculum. In many 
				 elementary schools, teachers have story time where they read to all of their students at once. 
				 The problem though is that during story time, many students often sit back passively as the 
				 teacher reads, only looking at the pictures when the book is turned their way. They 
				 sometimes get bored and may lose
				  interest in the story, listening to the teacher's voice out of one ear. Students also may not be
				familiar with some of the words in the book, but feel like they cannot interrupt the story to ask, or 
				feel too shy or afraid to do so. While students are sitting in a group with others, often they each 
				sit in passive isolation and don't get to physically engage with the book themselves. When the first
				graders do get to read picture books on their own or in small groups, they often don't think critically
				about what they are reading and just look at pictures, or they lose interest quickly because something else 
				grabs their attention. </p>
				<br />
				<p>From research and observations in the first grade classroom, we have thus found our 
				need: first graders learning how to read need to feel more engaged in the books they read in small 
				groups, feeling in control of what and when they read. 
				Our application is an immersive, interactive reading experience using Leap Motion technology
				 that seeks to enhance story time by engaging, entertaining, and empowering first grade students 
				 to read.
