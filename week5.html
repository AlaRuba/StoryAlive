      		<p>Our initial idea was a system that allowed a user to adjust the dynamics and expression of a piece
      		of music by making certain hand gestures. This system would be useful for student conductors to 
      		practice with. However, as we talked about possible implementation challenges and revisited the
      		use case and scenario of the product, we became less confident in the idea and how we could pursue it.
      		Although we liked that the use of gestures would really augment the experience, we were slightly unsure of the
      		user need for the application.
      		Thus, while we did brainstorm ways to prototype the original music idea, we also brainstormed other ideas
      		that we might be able to pursue with the Leap Motion.</p>

      		<p>Although our project coach could not make it to the section, we chatted with Professor Bernstein 
      		about our project and how we could prototype it, since after class, we were thinking of possibly pivoting
      		in our application area. Professor Bernstein recommended that we could take the app in the direction
      		of education--teaching conducting. He also advised us to look into solfeg as gestures and do some more
      		observations and interviews of conductors. For inspiration, we watched 
      		<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/video/2012/04/06/arts/music/100000001474891/demystifying-conducting.html">

    	 <h3>Brainstorming Session 2</h3>
    	<div class="row-fluid">
      	<div class="span8 columns">
      		<p>We got together again to decide on an idea to prototype. We had another brainstorming session
      		and thought of a couple more ideas we wanted to pursue: a Beatpad simulator for percussionists and 
      		drummers who cannot afford physical Beatpads that would work with the Leap Motion and their laptops,
      		as well as a gesture based password system for your computer, and potentially house and car. In talking
      		about these ideas, we drew some quick sketches and mocks as a way of prototyping the idea. Some of 
      		these mocks are displayed on the right.</p>
      		<p>Ultimately though, we decided to circle back to our original idea with a stronger focus
      		and intent. We settled on an application that guides people to conduct--like Guitar Hero for conductors.
      		The reason behind this is that we found that this application definitely had a need
      		in beginning conducting classes and could be used to engage children and adults alike in
      		creating music themselves. The use of gestures in controlling the music's tempo,
      		dynamic, intensity, etc. definitely augments the experience and what gestures can accomplish
      		cannot be replicated by solely using a mouse or existing interface. </p>

       <h3>Feasibility Test</h3>
      <div class="row-fluid">
      	<div class="span8 columns">
      		<h4>Rationale</h4>
      		<p>Because our application would require gestures controlling music, we decided
      		it was necessary to begin testing just how feasible our idea would be, especially how
      		we could program the music to respond to the gestures accurately and in an aesthetically 
      		pleasing way.</p>
      		<h4>What we did</h4>
      	    <p>We played around with both Leap Motion and MIDI sound technologies.
         For the Leap, wesearched the developer portal for every example he could find to
        get an idea for what it is capable of and to hopefully spark some ideas for cool uses of
        it applied to our music topic. We also installed and ran the Javascript Leap Library, because as a
        group we are relatively comfortable with the language. </p>
      		<h4>Lessons Learned</h4>
      		<p>From this library, we
        determined that it was clumsy to modify objects with your hands using the rotating
        and scaling gestures. However, lucky for our idea, simple tracking in 3D space works perfectly.
        In the exploration of the project's sound component, we decided to test out MIDI-JS.
         One of our ideas consisted of music playing at a perfectly 
        even velocity and then changing the velocity with one's gestures. We found that you 
        could alter the velocity of the individual notes while it was playing them, but we 
        could only figure out how to get the granularity of the velocity change to about
         100 notes. We hope to explore other libraries such as Max/Msp to
         get past that blocking issue and discover how to control the velocity and volume
          of single notes in real time. We also determined that one of our later ideas 
          of a kind of guitar-hero for conductors would be easier to implement and 
          would involve insuring the timing of the gestures was correct. However it 
          would be cool to make the app give you feedback in the sense of a changed 
          tempo and velocity.</p>

      <h3>UI Mockup of System</h3>
      <div class="row-fluid">
      	<div class="span8 columns">
      		<h4>Rationale</h4>
      		To better understand our idea of guiding the user to conduct a piece of music,
      		we needed to visualize the interface. 
      		<p></p>
      		<h4>What we did</h4>
      		We sketched out a few ways we could implement the interface. One idea was to have
      		colored and uncolored dots on the screen. Users move their hands to match colored 
      		dots accordingly and dots are colored in an order that simulates the act of 
      		conducting. We expanded this idea to accomodate the two hands of a conductor/user
      		and then also thought the user should be able to see what an actual conductor sees:
      		the orchestra. In another version of our mock, we sketched out the layout of a 
      		typical orchestra labeled according to instruments. We tried then to figure out how to
      		overlay the gesture interface over this orchestral view, and again, tried to mimic
      		as much as possible what an actual conductor sees (the orchestra and the score).
      		These processes and the final
      		digital mock is displayed to the right.
      	    <p></p>
      		<h4>Lessons Learned</h4>
      		<p>We were reminded about the importance of mapping, especially for this 
      		gestural guidance interface. As much as possible, we drew inspiration for the interface
      		from real life scenarios in order to help our user, an aspiring beginner conductor,
      		in a more conducive manner. We learned that this holistic view gave users a sense
      		of understanding and made them feel more natural.</p>

    <h3>Video Prototype of Interaction</h3>
      <div class="row-fluid">
      	<div class="span8 columns">
      		<h4>Rationale</h4>
      		<p>To simulate the interaction and study how gestures control the music, we decided it was
      		necessary to create a video prototype to illustrate the point.</p>
      		<h4>What we did</h4>
      		<p>Using our UI mocks, we matched Pachelbel's Canon in D with a series of mockups in a video
      		clip and simulated conducting the piece by matching the gestures in the video clip at the
      		right moment, in accordance with the sounds being played. In the actual application,
      		we would like to dynamically update the score, though this feature is not shown
      		in the video prototype. The result is the following: </p>
      	    <iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/ZejLUdMideo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      		<h4>Lessons Learned</h4>
      		We learned that highlighting the sections in the orchestra was important to give the user
      		feedback on his actions. Additionally, through the video prototype, we realized that 
      		besides simply colored dots to indicate where hand placement while conducting, we should
      		also show the path between the dots, or at the very least, inform the user to be
      		as fluid and natural in his movements as possible to look like a more professional conductor.
