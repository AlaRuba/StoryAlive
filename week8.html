    	<h1>Milestone 4: User Testing</h1>

    	<h2>Progress since last milestone</h2>
		<div class="row-fluid">
			<div class="span8 columns">
			<p>We tested out our last project idea in class by doing a wizard of oz with several users, including
			Molly and Professor Bernstein. The session with Molly is shown below. During class, we got some useful feedback on
			our app that forced us to reevaluate how gestures could help solve our user's need. In particular, we realized that
			signing one's signature in the air is in fact harder than it is on paper and less consistent - not an action we do
			often. It also does not leverage the 3D capability of the Leap technology and could be accomplished on something like an 
			iPad. We realized that with this idea, we still needed to hone in on how we could really use gestures to the fullest and
			most useful extent. This led us to revisit one of our previous ideas - gesture based passwords. During class, we talked
			more about the feasibility of implementing this and decided it would be too unrealistic to finish by the project
			deadline because it relied solely on machine learning and very little on actual interface design. Since we would all
			like to get more experience actually creating visual interfaces, and because none of us actually has a background in
			machine learning, we decided against implementing gesture based passwords as our final idea.</p>
			<iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/60C_43ApwbA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
			
			<br />
			<p>Thus, we headed back to the drawing board and really dug deep into our passions and values to generate our final
			idea for this project. Going back to our interest in education, mentioned at the end of Milestone 7, we saw that there is
			a need to increase literacy around the world and a strong need to help young struggling readers. 
			Based on observations of first grade students at Nixon Elementary reading during story time, and research into the digital
			e-book and interactive picture book space, we finalized our idea as an immersive, interactive 3D
            reading experience that seeks to engage, entertain, and empower first grade students to read, and to 
            help young readers develop literacy and improve their critical thinking skills. </p>
            
			<p>We created a wizard of oz of our story experience <a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B8Q9TKPRV1TEVW9Hc0ZUZ3lOdlE/edit?usp=sharing">
			here</a> and tested it out below. From our wizard of oz experience, we learned that it's important to give the
			user strong clues as to what parts of the story and what characters they can interact with, and to help them develop
			a mental model for what to expect when doing certain interactions on the screen. For example, hovering over a character
			longer causes a bigger movement than just highlighting the character.
			We aim to do more iterations of wizarding with more users over the weekend in conjunction to developing the 
			functional version of the app in preparation for our user testing next week.</p>

				<h3>Introduction</h3>
				<h4>Motivation</h4>
				<p>In many elementary schools, teachers have story time where they read to all of their students at once. 
				The problem though is that during story time, many students often sit back passively as the teacher reads. 
				They may lose interest in the story, or they might not know a certain word in the book, but feel to afraid or 
				shy to ask what it means. Often, students don't get to physically engage with the book themselves. On the 
				flip side, when the first graders read picture books on their own or in small groups, they often don't 
				think critically about what they are reading and just look at pictures, or they may get distracted from 
				the book easily.</p>
				
				<p>Technology is becoming more prevalent in schools these days, as many classrooms and libraries are equipped
				 with computers and are beginning to figure out how to integrate other technologies like the iPad into their 
				 curriculum. Because the LEAP motion is cheaper than the iPad, we are also motivated to examine how the 
				 Leap can be used as an engaging and more cost-effective technology in the classroom for teaching and learning.</p>
				 
				 <h4>Goals</h4>
				 <p>Our goal is to make children's books come alive--to create an engaging and interactive reading experience 
				 for first-graders learning how to read so that they feel more engaged in the books they read in small groups 
				 and in control of their reading. We want our application to empower students to think critically about the 
				 story and be able to draw out insights. By leaving parts of the story unfinished for the user to interact 
				 with and complete, our application will encourage students to be active participants in the storytelling 
				 process. In this way, we hope to help students develop total literacy, confidence, and interest in reading.
				 </p>
				 
				<h4>The book: Franny the Firefly</h4>
				 <p>We thought it would be best to use our project to illustrate what these interactive story books could look like, and
				 therefore used an example picture book as the main story in our project. This book was written and illustrated
				 by Cindy last spring quarter with the help of three other group members as a project in Cindy's PWR2 class, "Once 
				 Upon a Cause: Picture Books for Local Children", taught by Erik Ellis. The actual crafting of the book followed an iterative,
				 user-centered design process, involving several rounds of storyboarding, feedback sessions from both classmates as well
				 as first graders and teachers at Nixon Elementary, copywriting, and illustrating. The final book itself as used in 
				 this project is the result of a strongly iterative design process centered around first graders at Nixon over the span
				 of a quarter.
				 </p> 
				  
				 <h4>Features - Rationale, Hypotheses and Questions</h4>
				 <ul>
					<li>Pre-recorded version of story. Kids can choose to have book read to them (listen to audio) and 
					highlight words as voice reads<, or read the book aloud themselves.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Rationale</li>
							<p>Reading aloud to young children, particularly in an engaging manner, promotes emerging literacy and 
							language development. Having a book read aloud to a child causes pleasurable emotions in the child.
							Reading aloud is, according to the landmark 1985 report “Becoming a Nation of Readers,” “the single most 
							important activity for building the knowledge required for eventual success in reading. 
							Research has shown that children may learn to read better, think better, imagine more richly, and
							become a passionate and lifelong reader under this practice.</p>
						</ul>
					<li>Dictionary of words/hyperlinks to definitions so students can recognize and learn new vocabulary words</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Rationale</li>
							<p>Reading is considered to be a key element of vocabulary development in school-age children. 
							Learning vocabulary from these 
							experiences includes using context, as well as explicit explanations of words and/or events in the story. 
							This may be done using illustrations in the book to guide explanation and provide a visual reference or 
							comparisons, usually to prior knowledge and past experiences. We'd thus like to include definitions to words
							the first graders might not know to help them expand their arsenal of vocabulary. </p>
						</ul>
					<li>Drag items onto the main character, Franny, to try on</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Rationale</li>
							<p>This is important for the students to engage with the characters in the book for them to feel interested.
							This aspect of the app features a shelf of items for Franny, the main character, to try on. The kids will drag
							these items onto Franny and think about what will happen after Franny tries on the items. This will help
							students develop a notion of cause and effect relationships. The students will then be able to see an animation
							of what happens after Franny tries on the object to see if their guess was correct.</p>
						</ul>
					<li>Animated characters</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Rationale</li>
							<p>To make the story feel more alive, the characters and parts of the book students cannot directly interact
							with will still be moving and slightly animated to give the book a more alive feel. This engages the 
							student more and makes the story feel more relatable and living - a story come alive. Students become more
							interested in reading this way.</p>
						</ul>
					<li>Draw out lights of fireflies</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Rationale</li>
							<p>To make the reader feel like he/she is an active participant in the reading experience, there are two 
							parts of the story where the reader will have the chance to essentially help create the illustrations that
							go along with the story. Readers will be able to draw in the lights that come out of the fireflies in the book.
							This interaction is necessary because it empowers the first graders to be in control over what they
							read and teaches them early on that they make an impact and their presence matters to the creation of the 
							story. This will encourage the students to read more and become more engaged.</p>
						</ul>
					<li>Audio</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Rationale</li>
							<p>To engage more of the five senses, we will add audio in to create a truly immersive experience. For
							example, having the sound of crickets during the part of the book where Cricket sings, would help
							illustrate this point of the story much more clearly. This feature will help readers understand the
							context and content of the story better.</p>
						</ul>
					<li>Answer questions posed by the book before critical moments</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Rationale</li>
							<p>Because our app is applicable to students who may be reading in small groups in front of a 
							computer screen, alone, or with a parent, it's important to help the child learn how to critically
							think about the content in the book. Often, teachers during story time will pause before certain
							sections of the book and poll the students to ask them about the story as a means of engaging them.
							This feature seeks to emulate that rich experience and can be used when parents and teachers, figures
							who would be asking the students of these questions,
							are absent.</p>
						</ul>
					
				</ul>
				 
	
				 
				 <h4>General Driving Questions</h4>
				 <p>Will the interactivity in the experience enhance or detract from the students' experience of reading the
				  book? Will our application help the students understand the content of the book and grasp its message? Will
				  students be more engaged in reading and enjoy the digital experience better than the traditional book? Will
				  the students find the gestures used to interact with the app (swipe, hover, etc) intuitive to use?
				 </p>
				 
				 <h4>General Hypotheses</h4>
				 <p>We think that the students will be really fascinated and taken by the technology, and they will really want
				 to play with it. They will likely spend a lot of time moving the objects on the page, thus getting to know 
				 the story. We think the kids will be very engaged and will like the Leap experience because it's fun. The gestures
				 we believe will be confusing to the first graders at the start of the study. There will also be a lot of noise in
				 their gestures, since they may not fully remember the gestures. First graders also tend to be very physical, so
				 there could be other gestures they do unintentionally that may get mapped to gestures in our technology.
				 </p>

				<h3>Methods</h3>
				<h4>Recruiting Participants</h4>
				<p>Cindy sent an email to Kim Powell, a first grade teacher at Lucille M. Nixon Elementary near Stanford, on
				 Wednesday 2/27, asking if we could go into her class next week to test our application with her students. 
				 For her PWR class last spring quarter, Cindy worked with another teacher at Nixon to create a book for her
				 students, so Cindy felt comfortable reaching out to Kim because our project is in the same vein. We have 
				 written consent forms to give to the parents of the students to sign as well. The first grade students at
				  Nixon are about 6-7 years old and are pretty varied in terms of their backgrounds. We expect to test on 
				  a relatively even number of both female and male students. We will try to test on at least 8 students
				  (4 groups of 2) - while also trying to accomodate the needs of the teacher and other students in the room.
				  Each group will get about 5-10 minutes and we will be sure to respect the teacher and students' time. If 
				  it looks like the students don't finish reading the story on the computer, we will hand the paper copy of the book to them
				  to finish while another group tries out the technology.
				</p>
				
				<h4>Study Design</h4>
				<p>Next Tuesday, we will go into Kim Powell's first grade class at Lucille M. Nixon Elementary
				for 30-45 minutes. We will break up the class into pairs of 2 first-graders each and set up our application
				in one corner of the classroom. While one pair of students is trying out our application, the other students 
				will do reading activities as directed by their teacher. Kim will help us explain to her students that we are
				 a group of Stanford students creating an interactive storybook and wanted to try it out with them as we set up.
				</p>
				
				
				<h4>System setup and Environment</h4>
				<p>We are going to set up the Leap with one of our laptops on a desk at eye level to the students. We will
				then have our application loaded on the computer for the students to start using immediately.</p>
				
				<h4>Sequence of Events</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>We will tell the students they are going to read a picture book on our laptop.</li>
					<li>First, students will go through our tutorial in the beginning of the story, introducing them to the gestures such as swiping to turn 
					the pages and selecting and dragging objects.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Don't help them out unless they explicitly ask and are really struggling</li>
							<li>Note how easy it is for them to do these tasks, how accurately they do it. Do they do other gestures
							instead? What are they saying? Have them talk aloud during this process.</li>
						</ul>
					<li> Once students feel comfortable with the gestures, we will have them start reading the story. </li>
						<ul>
							<li>Students will have the option to have the story read aloud to them, or to read 
							the story aloud themselves.</li>
							<li>Note which one they chose. Does it correlate to how comfortable they seem in their speech?
							How outgoing they seem? Do struggling readers choose this option more?</li>
						</ul>
					<li> On the first page, note how they interact with the book. This is important because it is their first impression
					and start of using the leap based interactive book. Have them turn the page.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Note the types of gestures they do. Do they correctly do the gestures they practiced in the tutorial? 
							Do they remember these gestures? What other gestures do they do? What are they saying? Talk aloud.</li>
							<li>Note their reaction to their gestures. Are they delighted and surprised by what happens
							on the screen because of their gestures?</li>
							<li>How easy is it for them to interact with the book? Do they struggle to do or recall the gestures?
							Do they want to touch the screen instead?</li>
						</ul>
					<li>Have students draw out lights of other fireflies in the story by following cues on the screen</li>	
						<ul>
							<li>Do they notice the cue and follow through with the action? Is it confusing, do they have
							questions? Do they know what they are doing in relation to the story? Have them talk aloud.</li>
						</ul>
			
					<li> On pages 12-13 and pages 14-15, students drag items onto Franny, the main character. </li>
						<ul>
							<li>Do they understand what they are doing in relation to the story? What do they think will happen
							as the effect of their actions?</li>
							<li>Does the animation following the placement of the item onto the character delight them? Talk aloud.</li>
						</ul>
					<li> Have them continue to read through the story and interact with each page, following the cues for interaction. </li>
						<ul>
							<li>Do they know how or where to interact with the characters? We will have subtle cues (bouncing colored dots, etc.)
							next to characters that they should interact with. Do they notice? Do these cues help? Should these cues be
							more obvious? Are text based or visual cues more effective for them?</li>
						</ul>
					<li>After the study, have kids look at the paper version of the book</li>
						<ul>
							<li>How do they react to the paper copy? What do they do with it? Which version do they prefer?</li>
						</ul>
					
				</ol>
				
				<h4>Specific Tasks to test</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>Turn pages</li>
					<li>Draw out the lights of the fireflies in the story</li>
					<li>Drag items onto the main character, Franny, to try on</li>
					<li>Answer questions posed by the book before critical moments</li>
					
				</ol>
				
				
				
				<h4>Collecting Data</h4>
				<p>Because first graders are often very vocal, we will ask them during the task to do a talk-aloud protocol. 
				This will be the most natural easy, and effective way both for the students to give us their thoughts and feedback,
				and for us to distill insights. We will also observe where students have difficulty in our system and interview 
				them after they have finished reading to ask for their thoughts on the entire reading experience compared to 
				regular story time or reading on their own. We will also interview them while they are engaging with the 
				printed copy of the book. We will take down everything the students say instead of having them fill out a survey
				because it is faster and easier for them to do just talk instead of write or type. Additionally, we will
				try to record or take pictures of the students interacting with the technology during critical moments.
